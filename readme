What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write

  Statement has no visible effect --- no values are modified. (Use -noeffect to
  inhibit warning)
symtablelist.c:278:9: Statement has no effect: pfApply((const c...
